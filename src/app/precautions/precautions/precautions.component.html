        <p>
            Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your
            national and local public health authority. Most people who become infected experience mild illness and
            recover, but it can be more severe for others. Take care of your health and protect others by doing the
            following:

            <mat-list-item class="sub-heading">Wash your hands frequently</mat-list-item>
            <p>
                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and
                water.

                why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on
                your hands.

            <mat-list-item class="sub-heading">Maintain social distancing</mat-list-item>
            <p>
                Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

                Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may
                contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if
                the person coughing has the disease.

            <mat-list-item class="sub-heading">Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</mat-list-item>
            <p>
                Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus
                to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. </p>

            <mat-list-item class="sub-heading">Practice respiratory hygiene</mat-list-item>
            <p>
                Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your
                mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
                immediately.

                Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from
                viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

            <p>
                Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider, your national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

                Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.
